# petty-framework
Recreating Laravel's Illuminate framework from scratch as a learning exercise to gain a deeper understanding of Laravel's inner workings. Actually, it's made due to my exam not allowing to use any framework, so I made my own framework. It's not perfect, but it's working... I guess.
